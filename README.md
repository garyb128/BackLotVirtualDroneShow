This was part of a commerical project where I was tasked with developing code that made objects mimic the behaviour of drones flying to different shapes like in a drone show.
The user can define the amount of drones, and then input a  series of meshes/objects of their choosing.
Once running, the drone would fly and take position on each individual vertex of a series of given meshes, making it look like the drones are taking shape midflight.
